 6. Filter out any issues with a score less than 50. If there are no issues that meet this criteria, do not proceed.
 7. Use a Haiku agent to repeat the eligibility check from #1, to make sure that the pull request is still eligible for code review.

+8. **CRITICAL NEW STEP - AUTO-FIX ISSUES**: Before posting the review comment, **immediately fix all issues with score >= 50**. This is MANDATORY and must be done before step 11. For each issue:
+   a. Use Read tool to read the affected file
+   b. Use Edit tool to fix the issue based on the review feedback
+   c. Verify the fix addresses the issue
+   d. Do NOT commit yet - fix all issues first
+
+9. **COMMIT ALL FIXES**: After all issues are fixed, commit the changes:
+   a. Use `git add` to stage all modified files
+   b. Create a commit with message:
+      ```
+      fix: コードレビュー指摘事項を自動修正
+
+      - [list all fixed issues]
+
+      Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
+      ```
+   c. Push to the PR branch using `git push origin <branch-name>`
+
+10. **UPDATE PR DESCRIPTION**: Use `gh pr edit <PR number> --body "..."` to update the PR description, noting that code review issues have been automatically fixed.
+
+11. Finally, use the gh bash command to comment back on the pull request with the result. **Add a note that issues have been automatically fixed in commit [sha]**. When writing your comment, keep in mind to:
    a. Keep your output brief
    b. Avoid emojis
    c. Link and cite relevant code, files, and URLs
+   d. Include this format:
+
+      Found X issues and **automatically fixed them** in commit [sha]:
+
+      1. <issue description>
+
+      **Fixed**: <fix description>
+
+**CRITICAL**: Steps 8, 9, and 10 are MANDATORY. Do NOT post the review comment without completing these steps first. Failure to auto-fix issues is a violation of CLAUDE.md rules and will result in blocked execution.
