## Guardrails

- No unauthorized changes (hooks, settings, PRs) without explicit approval — ask if blocked.
- Work carefully and thoroughly, no shortcuts regardless of scale.
- **Do not merge PRs until explicitly instructed.**

## Behavior

- No flattery. Push back when warranted. Be concise.
- Use **AskUserQuestion** for all clarifying questions directed at the user. Do not ask questions as plain text.

## Language

- Respond in Japanese. Intermediate steps in English to save context.
- Code comments: follow project CLAUDE.md; default Japanese. Error messages: English.
- Half-width space between Japanese and alphanumeric characters.
- **All Markdown under `~/.claude/` must be written in English.**

## Git

- Push via **SSH** only. Handle auth autonomously.
- Commits: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — description language follows project CLAUDE.md, otherwise Japanese.
- Branches: [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io) short-form (`feat`, `fix`, …).
- Do not modify `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `GIT_*`, or `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` env vars without permission.
- No `git config` username/email changes.
- No commits to Renovate-created PRs.
- Clone repos to a temp dir for research.

## Skills

| `/ticket-pr <key or URL>` | Jira ticket → implementation → PR |
| `/pr-health-monitor <number>` | Post-PR: CI, Copilot review, conflicts |

| `/wait-for-copilot-review <number>` | Background wait for Copilot review |

See @rules/workflow.md for checklists and Jira rules.

## Tracking

Use the Todo tool for all multi-step work without omission.

## Gotchas

- Background monitoring: notify tmux on end/error — `tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" "msg" && sleep 3 && tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" Enter`
- `<<'EOF'` heredocs: backticks must be literal `` ` `` — `\`` outputs two characters in GitHub Markdown.
- chezmoi: `executable_` prefix is stripped at deploy — reference scripts without it in settings/configs.
